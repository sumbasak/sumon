# README
This script allows parsing data from files that are exported from OVITO. Specific file templates are available in this folder to better understand the script. With the stored data for the first and second shells, Matplotlib scripts would help visualize the data in 2D more aptly. One instance of such Matplotlib has been provided as an example too.
