The last update to this code was made on **13-Oct-2023**.

**q6-functions.py** contains all the functions, including the main function, used to calculate the average q6 value of each frame.

**q6-mainloop.py** would allow the function to be run and would provide the output in the designated folders of choice. 

**q6-parameters.py** takes all the parameters and initialization of variables to make the code complete and compile.
