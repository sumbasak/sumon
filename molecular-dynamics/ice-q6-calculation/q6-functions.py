    In this particular file, only the coordinates and velocities are required. Nothing else is necessary.
    In this code, all the lines have been split into their component elements and have been stored as a list of elements.

    The list is comprised of all the elements, like Residue Number, Residue Name, Atom Number, X, Y, Z, Vx, Vy, Vz.
    Since there is a bit of anomaly after the 10000th line, only the last six columns are being called to store. To do that,
    an empty numpy array has been created with 6 columns and a requisite number of rows (line_count - 3). The first two and the last
    lines are of no use. 

    .split() allows splitting all the elements from all the lines.

    For iatom, all jatom distance would be calculated at first. Then, those jatom distance values would be
    taken into account whose o_range values are smaller than 0.35, the cut-off box_lennce. 

    For those jatoms, who make the cut, let's call them jcatom. Now, for every jatom inside the if loop,
    there would be one extra coordination that would be counted. Each jatom would require a calculation
    of all the y values. Once the y value calculation for one jcatom is done, then, other jatom would be
    iterated. If this jatom also makes the cut, then, this jcatom would add another coordination, and
    y values would be updated with the new calculations.

    Now, these y values contain values for 2 jatom and the coordination number is 2. After the calculation
    of all jatom, we would have total y values. If 10 jatom are there, then, the coordination number would be 10
    and all y values of all those jcatom would be summed up.

    Once calculation for that iatom is done with all other jatom, all those y values would be divided by 
    the number of all jatom. These are <y> values for that precise iatom. Subsequently, all the <y> values 
    would be used to calculate their conjugates.

    Using those conjugate values, the final q6 value of that iatom would be calculated. 

    Now, if the q6 value satisfies a certain condition, say, it lies between 0.0 and 1.0, that q6 value would
    be added to the q6total and that iatom would be added to the number of atoms that has
    q6 value fulfilling this condition, 0.0 < q6 < 1.0.

    Finally, q6total would mean summing all those iatom whose q6 had fulfilled the criterion and their
    total count, say coord_total. By dividing q6total with the coord_total, the q6average value
    can be calculated. 
    
    Note: All the calculations are being performed on a nanometer scale. Remember, all other analyses using MDAnalysis
    would use Angstrom.
