# README
This public repository contains all the codes that I have written so far. Be it molecular dynamics, machine learning, or even mathematical practice problems. All codes find their home in this repo. All codes should be used with caution and should be modified to suit the circumstances and needs. 

Some folders contain their initial completion dates. Some don't. That is because the **Github** page is quite new and some scripts are old. Folders where `readme.md` files don't contain any dates, should be understood that the folder's scripts have been written very recently and uploaded.

All Python scripts are scribbled for use in specific Python IDE (like Jupyter Lab or Google Colab) and thus, the code blocks may contain certain magic commands that are used for only those IDEs. In other IDEs, those magic commands may render errors and should be removed before compiling.
 
_Since my project in **Molecular Dynamics** is continuing and the manuscript is being prepared, all Python scripts won't be uploaded until the article is published._
