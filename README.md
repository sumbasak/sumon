# WELCOME
This repository contains all the codes that I have written so far. I majorly rely on Python for my day-to-day tasks. However, I also write bash and C++ scripts if there is a need to. 

💡Project 0: Lennard Jones Interactions

My initial project was Lennard Jones interaction calculations. I call it Project 0 because it taught me how to structure code, debug, and perform I/O operations. 

💡Project 1: Ice Growth

This project deals with the crystalline growth of ice on prism and basal planes. I contributed to the understanding of water behavior at the ice surface, its transrotational movement, and finally, the influence of neighbors in the occurrence of specific ice polymorphs. 

💡Project 2: Enzyme Classification

This project aims to develop an ML model that can classify enzymes at level 1, that is, the parent 7 classes of enzymes. I explored natural language processing (NLP)-led feature engineering, classifier model development, and its validation on an independent data set. 

📝PS1: Both of my manuscripts are under preparation. That is why, specific codes have been left intentionally blank. Once all these projects are published, all codes would be updated. 

📝PS2: All these Python scripts have been written in Jupyter Lab and Kaggle, thus, certain magic commands (say, %%time) that work in those IDEs may render errors in other IDEs. I urge anyone to practice caution if any code is being reused.
